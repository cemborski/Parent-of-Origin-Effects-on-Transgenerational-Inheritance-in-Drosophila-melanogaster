Ancestral diet transgenerationally influences offspring in a parent-of-origin and sex-specific manner

Abstract
Parent-of-origin effects, whereby specific phenotypes are differentially inherited either paternally or maternally by offspring, provide useful clues to better understand transgenerational inheritance and transmission. Ancestral diet has been repeatedly shown to influence offspring phenotypes, including body composition and fitness. However, the specific role that mothers and fathers play in the transmission of altered phenotypes to male and female offspring remains unclear. In the current study, we investigated the influence of the matriline, patriline, and parentalineâ€™s diet on adult progeny phenotypes and reproductive success.  Males and females were exposed to either a control diet or one of two altered (no- or high-) sugar treatment diets for a single generation.  Control and treatment flies were then mated to each other in a full factorial design to produce F1 offspring. To limit any phenotypic differences to ancestral diet, F1-F3 descendants were exposed exclusively to control media. We found both parent-of-origin specific (triglyceride) and non-parent-of-origin specific (sugar) effects, which were transgenerational and sex-specific. Additionally, we observed an intergenerational maternal fitness effect, which negatively correlated with triglycerides, indicating a deleterious effect of ancestral diet. This work highlights the phenotypic influence of mothers and fathers on their progeny and provides phenotypic clues for future mechanistic research.

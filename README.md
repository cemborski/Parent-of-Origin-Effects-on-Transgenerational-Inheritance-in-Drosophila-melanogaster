Ancestral diet transgenerationally influences offspring body composition and fitness in a parent-of-origin and sex-specific manner

Abstract
Parent-of-origin effects, whereby specific phenotypes are differentially inherited either paternally or maternally by offspring, provide useful clues to better understand transgenerational inheritance, and represent a first step to hypothesizing possible modes of transmission. Ancestral diet has been repeatedly shown to influence offspring phenotypes, including body composition and fitness. However, the specific role that the matriline and patriline play in the transmission of altered phenotypes to male and female offspring remains unclear. In the current study, we investigated the influence of the matriline, patriline, and parentalineâ€™s diet on adult progeny phenotypes and reproductive success.  Here, males and females were exposed to either a high-sugar or control diet for a single generation and mated to each other in a full factorial design to produce the F1 generation. To limit any phenotypic parent-of-origin differences to ancestral diet, F1-F3 descendants were exposed exclusively to control diet media. We found both intergenerational (F1) and transgenerational (F2-F3) parent-of-origin body composition effects that were sex-specific, where the matriline altered triglyceride levels in males and the patriline altered triglyceride and glycogen levels in females. Additionally, intergenerationally decreased maternal fitness effects were observed. Importantly, our work supports a significant paternal role for phenotypic transmission of altered traits that differs from that derived from the matriline, and sometimes parentaline, suggesting non-additivity of parent-specific effects.
